The object of the carbon measurement project is to determine the carbon load of the 17 different land use types (teak plantation, palm oil and forest â€“ all photographed, also coffee, cocoa, forest concessions (logged), industry forests (planted), etcâ€¦). Using GIS they select locations in Berau to represent the different land use types. They then select the site and by throwing a stick locate one corner of the 200 meter transect. After setting it up with a rope, they locate random areas around the transect and using 20 cm transect squares they determine the â€œwetâ€ weight of the top 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm. They weigh the samples, then put them in a bag to take back to the lab. At the lab, they dry the material and weigh the â€œdryâ€ weight. They will use the carbon load data, together with GPS data of land use types throughout the Berau District to determine the carbon load of the District and the changes over time. This data will be used by the Conservancy and partners in developing the REDD approach in the Berau District.

This approach is designed to capture information on generic variables, such as the country in which a study took place, the population focus, study design and the intervention being assessed. This standard and well-defined set of keywords and codes is essential whenever classifying and characterising studies in order for reviewers to pull out key aspects of each study in a systematic way.

The object of the carbon measurement project is to determine the carbon load of the 17 different land use types (teak plantation, palm oil and forest â€“ all photographed, also coffee, cocoa, forest concessions (logged), industry forests (planted), etcâ€¦). Using GIS they select locations in Berau to represent the different land use types. They then select the site and by throwing a stick locate one corner of the 200 meter transect. After setting it up with a rope, they locate random areas around the transect and using 20 cm transect squares they determine the â€œwetâ€ weight of the top 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm. They weigh the samples, then put them in a bag to take back to the lab. At the lab, they dry the material and weigh the â€œdryâ€ weight. They will use the carbon load data, together with GPS data of land use types throughout the Berau District to determine the carbon load of the District and the changes over time. This data will be used by the Conservancy and partners in developing the REDD approach in the Berau District.
