            Welcome to the Evidence for Nature and People Data Portal! This portal features data from a systematic map on the impacts of conservation on human well-being in non-OECD nations (Bottrill et al. 2014, McKinnon et al. 2015, 2016) drawn from 1,038 peer-reviewed and grey literature. Here, you can access the knowledge management tool and various analytic dashboards for slicing the data. As we progress in our different initiatives (see

This carbon monitoring project is the â€œground-truthingâ€ portion of the REDD project. The object of the carbon measurement project is to determine the carbon load of the 17 different land use types (teak plantation, palm oil and forest â€“ all photographed, also coffee, cocoa, forest concessions (logged), industry forests (planted), etcâ€¦). Using GIS they select locations in Berau to represent the different land use types. They then select the site and by throwing a stick locate one corner of the 200 meter transect. After setting it up with a rope, they locate random areas around the transect and using 20 cm transect squares they determine the â€œwetâ€ weight of the top 0-10 cm, 10-20 cm and 20-30 cm. They weigh the samples, then put them in a bag to take back to the lab. At the lab, they dry the material and weigh the â€œdryâ€ weight. They will use the carbon load data, together with GPS data of land use types throughout the Berau District to determine the carbon load of the District and the changes over time. This data will be used by the Conservancy and partners in developing the REDD approach in the Berau District. The team includes; Harti Ningsih (only woman-- with scarf around head), Heri Surriyanto (baseball cap and brown T-shirt) Ekowidya Daryono (brown long sleeves) Dayat (white T-shirt) and Yosua Naibaho (glasses and black cap).

          This is an open access online knowledge management tool designed to help users explore the existing evidence on linkages between nature and people. The evidence collated in this tool is designed to help conservation and development policymakers, practitioners, and researchers identify relevant information for decision-making. To date, there are ~1,000 peer-reviewed articles, unpublished reports, and theses in the evidence base that were identified and included using a systematic mapping method. You can read more about the motivation behind this project, the data and methodology, and this group in the

        <p>The glossary is the best place to figure out what types of actions or outcomes fall into which categories. Since we used either standardized typologies or synthesized frameworks, the definitions stem from those references. Below the definition, you find examples of what types of actions are included. The glossary can be found at the bottom of every page. Click the 'Show/Hide glossary' button to display the panel. You can also find the glossary in the ABOUT section, and then navigating to GLOSSARY.</p>
