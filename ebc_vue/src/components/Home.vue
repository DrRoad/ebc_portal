        <h3>Evidence for conservation</h3>
        <p>
          Global conservation initiatives are faced with a dual challenge: conserving natural ecosystems
          while improving human well-being. Achieving co-benefits for ecosystems, species, 
          and human communities will require robust evidence on what works, when, and how.
        </p>
        <p>
          The volume of data and research on conservation is a valuable asset to those seeking to pursue
          evidence-informed practice. Evidence synthesis methods are a “gold standard” for gleaning
          actionable insights from research in a transparent, comprehensive and unbiased manner.
          Syntheses are a critical tool for providing reliable and up-to-date information for decision-makers.
