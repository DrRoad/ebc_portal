There are a number of statistically significant determinants of participation. Two of the three economic variablesã income and landãare statistically significant. Households with supplementary income in addition to their income from agriculture are more likely to participate in user groups created by the PPP (coefficient = 0.477, significant at the 10% level). Similarly, households that own more land are more likely to participate to a greater extent in the groups created by the program (coefficient = 0.004, significant at the 5% level). Both the social variables are statistically significant. The high statistical significance of the caste variable confirms the hypothesis that lower-caste members participate relatively less in the user groups created by the PPP (coefficient = 0.554, significant at the 1% level). The education variable has a negative sign and is statistically significant (coefficient = -0.012, significant at the 5% level). This indicates that the higher the average number of years of education of the adult members in a household, the lower the likelihood of the household participating in the program.Of the two variables related to benefits from the resource (firewood and fodder), firewood is statistically significant. This means that as anticipated, households that use higher amounts of firewood from the forest are also more likely to try to participate in the program and to influence decision making in local groups through participation (coefficient = 0.1, statistically significant at the 5% level).

In essence, the programs are intended to achieve these twin goals by incentivizing local communities to manage state forests. However, there are pervasive imperfections in forest products markets that constrain the needed incentives; these imperfections arise mainly from limited infrastructure, high transport costs, few buyers, exploitive marketing chains and imperfect price information. One innovative approach to overcome these problems, which has been adopted by the Ethiopian government, is to organize JFM into community forest enterprises (CFE) in the form of forest usersê cooperatives (FUC) for forest products marketing.4 This provides the community with avenues for greater participation in value chains of forest products markets through vertical integration (VI) (Antinori, 2005; Gelo and Koch, 2014; Vega and Keenan, 2014).

From the decomposition analyses, our empirical results show that statistical 'discrimination' is the source of income disparity between male and female participants, accounting for 100 per cent of the total income differential, while the income disparity between high- and low-income participants is mainly due to the differences in endowments. This is consistent with the descriptive data, where high-income households have better endowments than low-income households in terms of age, education and household assets (land, livestock and private woodlots) which affect forest income.",No,,0,1,0,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,
